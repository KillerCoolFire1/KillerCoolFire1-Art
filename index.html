          Hello, i'll be doing mostly avatar art commissions. I'm also working
          on being able to make game thumbnails in a 2d art style. Since I am
          new it'll come as now surprise that I have no experience when it comes
          to doing commissions. However, I've been doing art for a while and
          improved over the years. I will keep on improving to make myself
          better. With that being said I hope you'll consider requesting art
          from me.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Do Commissions From <em class="RBold">Me?</em></h2>
        <img src="images/WHM.PNG" alt="Why Do Commissions From me?" />
        <p>You should get a commission from me because...</p>
        <p>1. My art is cheap and decent</p>
        <p>2. I do my best to make it look good</p>
        <p>3. It's very customizable</p>
        <p>
          4. You'll get the art within a <em class="RBold">week</em>. This means
          I can finsih it the day after you request the commission as longs as
          its within a weeks time.
        </p>
        <p>5. It'll help me become a better artist meaning better art</p>
